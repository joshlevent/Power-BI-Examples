## How to use DAX code
Notice that in DAX we are referencing other data with the syntax `Table[Column]`.

For the code to work with your data you will need to rename the references in the code to match your data or rename your table and columns to match the code.

## How to use Power Query code
In general I provide code that generates sample data. To apply the code to your data, you will need to replace the sample data with your own data. An LLM tool should be able to help you with this (e.g. [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/), [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude), [chatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)).

## Additional Help
For additional help, please first take a look at the official documentation or ask your LLM to do so:

[General Power BI Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/)

[DAX Reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/)

[Power Query Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/)

Finally, if you get stuck, you can ask a question on the [Official Power BI Forums](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Power-BI-forums/ct-p/powerbi).
